shitty game v0.1 No copyright @ your mother 2023
where did you even get this

-------
Disclaimer: Game dialogue can be mildly offensive and includes cuss words. By playing this game, you accept that you have fully read the Terms and Conditions of using this software.
-------

This is a text-based game. You mostly type in numbers that correspond to the options on the screen.
You can examine your inventory and items in it by typing "INV" and "INSPECT" respectively.

Objects of interest are mostly surrounded in straight brackets: "[]"
Options that are enclosed in curly brackets "{}" advance the story, and you cannot go back after selecting them.

Example:
    Blah blah blah
    Option 1 [1]
    Option 2 [2]
    {Option 3} [3]

In this situation, you are free to choose from 1 to 3, though it is recommended that you try both 1 and 2 before proceeding.
(Putting in a + or - sign returns an error.)

I hope you understand, but if you don't there's no function to see this text again unless you restart the entire game.
Good luck, i guess.
