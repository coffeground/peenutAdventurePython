///////////      

This is a text-based game. You type in things the game tells you to.

Objects of interest are mostly surrounded in straight brackets: "[]"

Example:
    Blah blah blah
    Option 1 [1]
    Option 2 [2]
    Option 3 [3]

In this situation, you are free to choose from 1 to 3. Type in the selected number: enter '2' without the quotation marks, for example.
(Putting in a + or - sign returns an error.)

I hope you understand, but if you don't there's no function to see this text again unless you restart the entire game.
Good luck, i guess.
